/* k96Modbus.h - Library for serial data transfer to Senseair K96 NDIR
  
  Senseair K96 sensors use modbus protocol to transfer data over serial.
  Each command is 7 bytes that request a memory transfer of a given number of bytes.
  Each response is 8 bytes, the reply plus carriage return
  The error status register is 16 bits at memory location 0x0A
